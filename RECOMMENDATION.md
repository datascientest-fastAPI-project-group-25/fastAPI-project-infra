# Recommendation: Using Bun Scripts for GitHub Actions Workflows

## Summary

Based on the analysis of our current GitHub Actions workflows and the requirements for better maintainability, testability, and reusability, I **strongly recommend** using Bun with TypeScript for implementing helper utilities that can be called from our workflows.

## Why Bun?

Bun is an excellent choice for this use case because:

1. **Performance**: Bun is significantly faster than Node.js, which means faster workflow execution
2. **All-in-one solution**: Bun includes a runtime, package manager, bundler, and test runner
3. **TypeScript support**: Native TypeScript support without additional configuration
4. **Modern JavaScript**: Full support for modern JavaScript features
5. **Compatibility**: Compatible with most npm packages, including GitHub Actions libraries
6. **Simplicity**: Simpler configuration and setup compared to Node.js + TypeScript

## Implementation Approach

The recommended approach is to:

1. Create a `utils` directory with TypeScript utilities organized by domain (terraform, github, aws)
2. Install Bun in the workflow using the `oven-sh/setup-bun@v1` action
3. Call the utilities from the workflow using `bun run utils/src/path/to/script.ts`

### Example Workflow Integration

```yaml
- name: Setup Bun
  uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
  with:
    bun-version: latest

- name: Determine Environment
  id: set_env
  run: |
    output=$(bun run utils/src/terraform/environment.ts)
    echo "environment=$output" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

## Benefits Over Alternatives

### Compared to Bash Scripts

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **Better Error Handling**: Structured error handling with try/catch
- **Testability**: Easy to write unit tests for TypeScript functions
- **Reusability**: Import functions across different utilities
- **IDE Support**: Better code completion, documentation, and refactoring

### Compared to Node.js + TypeScript

- **Performance**: Bun is significantly faster than Node.js
- **Simplicity**: Less configuration required
- **All-in-one**: Built-in test runner, bundler, and package manager
- **Modern Features**: Better support for modern JavaScript features

### Compared to Deno

- **npm Compatibility**: Better compatibility with npm packages
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: More seamless integration with GitHub Actions libraries
- **Community Support**: Growing community and ecosystem

## Proof of Concept

We've created a proof of concept with two utilities:

1. **Environment Determination**: Determines the deployment environment based on context
2. **PR Merge Detection**: Detects if a push to main is from a PR merge

Both utilities include comprehensive tests and demonstrate the benefits of the TypeScript approach.

## Next Steps

1. Review the implementation plan in `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
2. Start with the initial setup and core utilities
3. Test the approach with a simple workflow update
4. Gradually migrate more complex scripts based on the results

## Conclusion

Using Bun scripts for our GitHub Actions workflows will significantly improve the maintainability, testability, and reliability of our CI/CD pipelines. The initial investment in setting up the utilities will be quickly offset by the benefits in terms of reduced errors, improved developer experience, and faster workflow execution.
