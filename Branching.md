Folder-Based Approach for Infrastructure on GitHub
# Folder-Based Approach for Infrastructure on GitHub

## Repository Structure

1. **Main Branch**:
   - **Purpose**: Acts as the stable version of your infrastructure code, reflecting the production state.
   - **Usage**: Only well-tested and approved changes are merged into the main branch.

2. **Feature Branches**:
   - **Purpose**: Used for developing new infrastructure features, testing configurations, or experimenting with changes.
   - **Usage**: Developers create feature branches from the main branch to work on specific tasks. Once validated, these changes are merged back into the main branch.

3. **Environment Folders**:
   - **Structure**: Organize your repository with folders for each environment (e.g., dev, staging, production) within the main branch.
   - **Purpose**: Each folder contains the specific Terraform configurations for that environment, allowing for environment-specific customization.

## Benefits

-  **Isolation of Environments**: Each environment has its own folder, which isolates configurations and reduces the risk of cross-environment issues.
-  **Modular Design**: The `modules` directory allows for reusable components, promoting consistency across environments.
-  **Simplified Management**: A single branch with environment-specific folders reduces complexity and makes it easier to manage and audit changes.
-  **Flexibility in Development**: Feature branches enable experimentation and development without affecting the stable configurations in the main branch.

## Considerations

-  **State Management**: Ensure that each environment maintains its own Terraform state file to prevent conflicts and maintain isolation.
-  **Backend Configuration**: Use Terraform backends (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage) to securely store state files and enable collaboration.
-  **Automation**: Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate deployments and ensure consistent, reliable infrastructure changes across environments.
